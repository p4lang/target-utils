The BigList module implements a doubly linked list. Various operations such as
appending, sorting, and finding elements are supported. The list elements are
dynamically allocated by the BigList module and store an opaque pointer given
by the user.

Many functions in this module return a pointer to the head of the new list,
however the returned list is constructed from elements of the passed in lists
and is not newly allocated.
