This module provides fundamental primitive structures for other 
modules.  

In general, each functional module tries to be both platform independent and 
provide a clean, self-contained and flexible interface with as few assumptions 
about deployment in a particular environment as possible. 

The AIM module provides portability infrastructure, common good-practice 
definitions, and fundamental primitives useful through the code to address 
common issues such as debug and output virtualization and configuration, 
logging. 

The AIM module cannot depend on any other module or any external package.
