 Buildroot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The buildroot/ directory contain the files to embed the klish package into the
buildroot environment. The buildroot/ files must be copied to the
buildroot's source tree package/klish directory. Then the package/Config.in
file must be changed. Add the following string

source "package/klish/Config.in"

to the section started with 'menu "Shell and utilities"' (or to the another
section if you think it will be better and you know what you do). After that you
can configure buildroot and enable the building the klish package. You can find
the menu for the klish within
"Package Selection for the target"->"Shell and utilities" in the configurator.
The klish's config allow to use the predefined version of klish or automatically
download the last revision from the SVN repository.

These files were tested with buildroot-2010.11.
